# Repositories Moved

I've moved almost all of my projects and content to a new location.

I am now hosting my repositories on a Gitea instance at [gitea.mattiamascarello.it](https://gitea.mattiamascarello.it). 

Gitea offers a more customizable and self-hosted environment that aligns better with my current needs and goals.

### What's still here?
Some repositories might still be available on GitHub for collaboration, archival, or mirroring purposes, but active development has shifted to the Gitea instance.
